  # WEEK 11 (PHASE 2): FRONTEND DEVELOPMENT
  
</div>

In this phase, we focused on the initial development of frontend pages that were tailored based on the use case diagram from Week 10. Each page was designed to reflect specific user interactions, such as account registration, login, and portfolio creation, to ensure consistency with the user flows. We also referred to the Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) to align with the required data structures, input fields, and planned features.
